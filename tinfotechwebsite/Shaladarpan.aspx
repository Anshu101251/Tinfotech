   <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Generally, school records are documented evidence of what a school does. School records contain data and information about various aspects of the school’s operations, including data about its students, teachers, classes, facilities, finances, exam, Government schemes, scholarship etc. Based on this data school administration and department authorities regularly make decisions and plan for future.
